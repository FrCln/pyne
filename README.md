# Pyne
## Python application lib
## version 0.1.0 alpha

## History
Why we call it 'Pyne'? Because we create it on Python and I want to call it 'Pine' ðŸŒ³
The first idea of Pyne created when I saw the Kivy.
It was time when my brother created his first programming language [_EPL_](https://github.com/wchistow/EPL/),
and I wanted to create pyne for _EPL IDE_(now it's on _Tkinter_, and I don't like it)

----

## Get started
#### simple example
This code create white window 500x500
```python
import pyne

app = pyne.App()

app.run()
```
